# Embark Atom themes

![Atom Theme](https://github.com/zmisson424/UbuntuTheme/blob/main/atom/atom.png)

This is a forked copy of [One Dark UI](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui). I updated the
color scheme to match my desktop experience and have started to tweak the design
to have a more material look and feel to it. This is still a work in progress.
